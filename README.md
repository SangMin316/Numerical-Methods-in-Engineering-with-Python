# Numerical Methods in Engineers with Python
* I studied computational physics dealing with numerical analysis in 2021.
* This repository includes numerical analysis(interpolation, linear algebra, etc.) using Numpy and Scipy.
* The class and the code used in the class are referenced in the book below.
